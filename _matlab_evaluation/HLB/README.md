# How to run evaluation?
First, open the repository in MATLAB (2019b or higher), navigate to <root>/_matlab_evaluation and add HLB folder and subfolders to the path. Then, navigate to /HLB folder.\
You can switch the between segmentation profile and evaluation profiles in the config.json file, which is found in <root>/_temp folder. You can explore the available segmentation and evaluation profiles in <root>/_matlab_evaluation/HLB/01_Segmentation/segmentor.m and 02_Evaluation/evaluator.m files. You must give the right segmentor and evaluator in the bottom of the config.json. You shall not modify the rest of this file.\
Also, please place the input measurement data in .mat extension in the _temp folder. \
Then, from MATLAB, run the matlab_evaluation_cover.m file (without any further parameters). Results are seen in the command window.
